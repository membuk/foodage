# **Foodage**
In this project, our main purpose is to prevent famine. We create an app that you can make your own predictions for your own menus. This app has two main components: prediction page and upload csv file page.

## **The Sustainable Development Goals**
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, are a set of 17 interlinked goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all." They were adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The SDGs address a wide range of global challenges, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace, and justice.

## **Our Goals**
Our project aligns with two goal of the SDGs:
* **Goal 2**: aims to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
* **Goal 12**: aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns

## **What are used?**
+ **Flutter** for cross-platform development of the user interface
+ **Tensorflow** and **Tensorflow Lite** for building and implementing artificial intelligence features

## **Prediction**

After viewing the file name and date, users can use their own data.

## **Features**
### **Clear UI**
Our app's UI is designed for simplicity and clarity, prioritizing an intuitive experience. With clear visuals and organized navigation, users can effortlessly engage with our TensorFlow-powered predictions, ensuring easy interpretation and actionable insights.

### **Language Support**
We have incorporated language support to cater to diverse language preferences. This expansion of language support significantly broadens the app's usability and makes it more accessible to a wider user base. For now, our app supports Turkish, English and Spanish languages.
